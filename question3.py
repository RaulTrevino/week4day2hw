# Write a program to implement a Linear Search Algorithm. Also in a comment, write the Time Complexity of the following algorithm.

# Hint: Linear Searching will require searching a list for a given number.



list = {10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50, 110, 100, 130, 170}
x = 110
if x in list:   #O(N)
    print('True')
else:
    print('False')
